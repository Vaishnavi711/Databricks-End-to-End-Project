ðŸ”¹ Databricks-End-to-End-Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on Azure Databricks. It covers the complete data lifecycle â€” from ingestion, transformation, and storage, to building curated datasets for analytics and reporting.
The project simulates a real-world scenario of processing raw transaction data into meaningful business insights.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

Compute: Databricks (Apache Spark)

Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)

Workflow Orchestration: Databricks Workflows / Jobs

Data Formats: CSV, Parquet, Delta Lake

Visualization: Power BI / Databricks SQL



Architecture

ðŸ”¹ Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)

Raw e-commerce transaction data (Parquet) ingested into ADLS.

Databricks Auto Loader used for incremental ingestion.

ðŸ”¹ Data Transformation (Silver Layer)

Data cleaning: handling nulls, duplicates, schema enforcement.

Data standardization: converting datatypes, normalizing categorical fields.

Business logic applied using PySpark (e.g., calculating order revenue, customer spend).

ðŸ”¹ Data Aggregation (Gold Layer)

Aggregated data prepared for analytics (sales by region, product category trends, monthly revenue).

Stored in Delta Lake format for efficient querying.

ðŸ”¹ Orchestration & Automation

Databricks Jobs/Workflows scheduled for daily runs.

Monitoring and logging enabled.

ðŸ”¹ Consumption Layer

Power BI / Databricks SQL connected to Gold tables.

Dashboards for Sales Trends, Top Customers, and Revenue KPIs.

ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented

âœ… Raw â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold Medallion Architecture
âœ… Schema enforcement & incremental loading with Delta Lake
âœ… Data quality checks (duplicate removal, null handling, schema validation)
âœ… Partitioning & optimization for query performance
âœ… Automated pipeline orchestration with Databricks Workflows



ðŸ”¹ Business Outcomes
Reduced manual data preparation effort by 80%.

Improved query performance using Delta Lake optimizations.

Delivered ready-to-use analytics datasets for downstream BI tools.
